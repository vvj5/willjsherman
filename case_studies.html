    <h4>SpotBooked</h4>
    SpotBooked was a project I inherited that had begun under one developer and moved to another developer and had completely stalled.<br><br>
    I was tasked with taking the app and managing the product redesign and development.<br><br>
    I liaised directly with the customer, who was remote, and who was not tech savvy whatsoever (he was a jackaroo with an idea). I communicated extensively with the customer and the development team to ensure we all understood what the app was meant to achieve, who the people using it would be and how it needed to work.<br><br>
    I started work by mapping the existing app structure and detailing the user types and process flows. I realised almost immediately that the existing structure and flows were completely wrong. 95% of the existing pages were completely unneeded or in the wrong place, there were broken links everywhere and the usability flows just went nowhere.<br><br>
   <img src="images/portfolio/spotbooked/sb_sitemap_current.gif" class="responsive-img" alt="SpotBooked"><br><br>
    One term arose consistently: "SIMPLE". This app was being developed to be used by the livestock industry, who are used to a maximum tech level of a fax machine. It had to be SIMPLE and INTUITIVE to use or it would not succeed.<br><br>
    Once I understood what the users needed to be, see and do, I drew up a new, much slimmer sitemap, bringing pages together into tiles and laying-out a UX design with a lot fewer pages. I also did a mockup of a dashboard page:<br><br>
    <img src="images/portfolio/spotbooked/spotbooked_complex_dashboard_version.gif" class="responsive-img" alt="SpotBooked"><br><br>
    But the more I looked at my map and my work, the more the word "SIMPLE" kept coming to mind, and I realised I had gone down the wrong path. We needed pages with LESS on them, where there was no question what was being shown and what could be done.<br><br>
    So I trashed my sitemap and started over. Here's the new structure I came up with:<br><br>
    <img src="images/portfolio/spotbooked/sb_sitemap_new.gif" class="responsive-img" alt="SpotBooked"><br><br>
    I then produced a sitemap/roadmap to help the dev team get from the current app structure to the new app structure:<br><br>
     <img src="images/portfolio/spotbooked/sb_sitemap_changes.png" class="responsive-img" alt="SpotBooked"><br><br>
    Using the mental image of a cowboy on a horse with a dog and a brand-new smartphone they may not even know how to use, I broke all the tiles out into individual, very basic pages. I got rid of the function icons and turned them into text-based buttons.<br><br>
    I then wrote User Stories for the sections, created and prioritised tickets for the dev team to get to work on.
    <img src="images/portfolio/spotbooked/SB_USER_STORIES.gif" class="responsive-img" alt="SpotBooked"><br><br>
    I had to pass the torch at this point, but I felt good about the state of the project when I left it.

    <h4>Critical Path</h4>
    Critical Path was an internal commercial project I was given at Two Red Kites that had last been touched five years ago. It was meant to be a "project management tool for non project managers" - to help with the creation, tracking and reporting across a multitude of projects simultaneously.<br><br>
    I was tasked with assessing, designing the product and overseeing the re-development of the entire project.<br><br>
    The discovery phase involved meticulously exploring and mapping the existing app, as well as doing research on competition and deciding functionality and flows.<br><br>
    The original app had been built without a sitemap, and there were broken links, missing buttons, inconsistent labelling and confusing workflows.<br><br>
    Using my experience as a project manager, I went away and designed what I felt would be a helpful basic workflow and feature list for the app. I then went back to the existing app and worked out what we had, what I wanted, what the delta between the two was and how to get there.<br><br>
    I wrote User Personas and User Stories and created a new sitemap and screen mockups to guide the dev team.<br><br>

    <h4>Book Mediation</h4>
    This was a freelance contract that I worked on from start to finish, from initiation to production release.<br><br>
    I worked with a data programmer who assisted with the calendar API interface and some of the site logic.<br><br>
    I worked with the customer directly on the site needs and advised on information architecture, UX design and site branding.<br><br>
    I began the process with a lot of questions and brainstorming, followed by multiple iterations of site wireframes, followed by more questions and more wireframes before really getting into the build.<br><br>
    <img src="images/portfolio/bookmed/site_flow2.jpg" class="responsive-img"><br><br>
    Once the sitemap was approved, I started to drill down into the button behaviours.<br><br>
    <img src="images/portfolio/bookmed/button_behaviors.jpg" class="responsive-img"><br><br>
    I had to manage hours, functionality and progress to ensure that the project ran on time and on budget.<br><br>
    We used Trello collaboratively as a group to track the progress of the app development and to add, change and rank urgency of tasks and bugs.<br><br>
    I used pencil and paper for wireframing and draft iterations, Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS (and a little JavaScript) for the build.<br><br>

    <h4>NDA Project</h4>
    The aim of this project was to create, from scratch, UX and UI for a customer with a very, VERY complex website involving multiple layers of filtering and dashboard presentation.<br><br>I asked a lot of questions. A LOT of questions. Then I involved the customer in the drawing of site maps and navigation flows, which gave me what I needed to begin wireframing and prototyping.<br><br>I also worked remotely with a front-end developer, who I collaborated with extensively on some design and information architecture decisions, based on what he needed to input his dashboard data and what would help him best structure the site.<br><br>Unfortunately, I was not able (for privacy reasons) to talk directly to any of the client's customers, so I am currently in the iterative process of making adjustments to the site based on data being collected by Google Analytics. <br><br>The customers were remote, so meetings were held via GoToMeeting, where I would walk the customers through draft iterations, take feedback and suggest solutions.<br><br>I used Illustrator and InVision for wireframing and draft iterations, Materialize (a CSS shell), HTML and CSS for the build.<br><br>I can't show the live site due to an NDA, but an unbranded draft can be seen below.<br><br>

    <h4>Arcturus</h4>
    This was a site redesign for a very text-heavy client site.<br><br> An oddity of this project was that I had to actually edit a great deal of the copy (the client is not a native English speaker).<br><br>My process involved the interesting challenge of interacting with a very eccentric client who has very eccentric customers, and I ended-up doing most of my research by visiting probably a dozen high-ranked similar sites to get an idea of what kind of format the likely visitors would be used-to (user interviews were not possible, and I received no responses to the questionnaire I sent to his mailing list, which may reflect an error on my part, but I am honestly still not sure).<br><br>I then created my initial set of wireframes and site flow maps, which had to be completely scrapped due to some communication misunderstandings. My second set were similarly scrapped entirely, but my third set finally wowed the client, and we were able to move forward with info architecture, editing and adding content.<br><br>My KPI on this site is pretty simple- email enquiries. I also check SE keywords and analyze visitor click-through flows and dwell times.<br><br>I used Illustrator for wireframing and InVision for prototyping and draft iterations, Jekyll (I used Jekyll because the site is pretty blog-heavy), Materialize (a CSS shell), HTML and CSS for the build.<br><br>
