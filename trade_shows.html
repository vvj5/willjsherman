                    ROLE~ Australian Marketing Manager for Genie Industries<br><br>
                        I was brought in to replace an entire ad agency, was responsible for entire continent's marketing activities, budgeting and reporting.<br><br>A large part of my work was trade shows and events, but maintaining the huge array of marketing materials was a monolithic task as well.<br><br>The agency I replaced had left everything an absolute shambles and had ripped-off the company for a great deal of money.<br><br>What I learned almost immediately was how to find ways to remove myself (or others) from the work chain and create more efficient practices, in order to increase my capabilities and spend my time where it SHOULD be spent.<br><br>As I typed all of this, I began to feel simultaneously proud and exhausted.<br><br>

                    <h4>CHALLENGES, SOLUTIONS and ACHIEVEMENTS</h4><br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>TRADE SHOW RESPONSIBILITIES~ Selection, budgeting, planning, executing, all logistics and promotion</li><br>
                        <li>CHALLENGE~ Went from 4 shows/year to 16/year in 3 years, budget had to be stretched when second brand was added.</li><br>
                        <li>CHALLENGE~ There was zero organization to trade shows: no criteria for selection, no inventory control, lots of waste, lots of confusion over responsibilities, budgets and gear.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SOLUTION~ Began managing the booth selection and layout for shows, even small rural shows</li><br>
                        <li>SOLUTION~ Began to produce "show kits" for each state to use and maintain themselves, which~<br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Saved time and money vs trying to ship back and forth from central office (and shows could often be double booked if salespeople were not communicating, which was frequently the case)</li><br>
                                <li>This also allowed for brand control, instead of states/customers making their own show gear that was often off brand or wasteful</li><br>
                                <li>Saved space in central parts warehouse, which was at a premium, and the time of the warehouse staff's time, which was even more a premium</li><br>
                                <li>Kits could be lent to blue chip customers to use, who often represented our brand at rural shows, which made customers feel they got more support.</li><br>
                            </ul>
                        <li>SOLUTION~ Began to control selection and mass production of branded swag and allocate to each state to manage (and account for how much of what was going where regularly).</li><br>
                        <li>SOLUTION~ Started promoting ahead of every show to support customers and drive attendance.</li><br>
                        <li>SOLUTION~ Devised a checklist for each show, which tracked budgeting, tasks and timeline to ensure thoroughness and accountability.</li><br>
                        <li>ACHIEVEMENT~ Won multiple "best booth" awards across the country, and helped create and improve relations with many customers, who needed to "feel the love."</li><br>
                        <li>ACHIEVEMENT~ Customers (and prospective customers) would come to the shows just to see the spectacle of our booth and "what the bloody hell that mad Yank had come up with this time." And to score awesome new swag, of course.</li><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Since the brewery was just starting, there was pretty much zero budget, so I had to be creative and resourceful. I BUILT the Jester King trade show booth out of salvaged fence material, making it easily portable and assembled, raising the sign and tshirt display above a crowd for visibility, and giving it a rustic, authentic, handmade feel.</li><br>
